## Tryouts
We had [CALICO Spring](https://calico.cs.berkeley.edu/) tryouts today. Teams will be announced soon.

## Conclusion
For this week, you can continue working on the problem set from last week. We'll be awarding cows to the top 3 performers who solve at least 6 problems and candy for everyone who solves at least 4 problems.
Thanks for coming, and we'll see you all next week!
