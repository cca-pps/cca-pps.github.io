## Tryouts
We had [CALICO Spring](https://calico.cs.berkeley.edu/) tryouts today. Teams will be announced soon.

## Officer Applications
Please consider appling to be an officer if you've attended most of the meetings this year and would be willing to help lead and organize the club next year. The application form can be found in your emails and on our discord. The deadline is 5/1.

## Conclusion
For this week, you can continue working on the problem set from last week. We'll be awarding cows to the top 3 performers who solve at least 6 problems and candy for everyone who solves at least 4 problems.
Thanks for coming, and we'll see you all next week!
