# Solutions

The solution slides we presented today can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Dl17YXGrbv-lJKZknKSW0VcVOMHHrAmwB2ZazhRBmwI/edit?usp=sharing).
We encourage everyone to implement the problems after reading the solutions, both for implementation practice and a better understanding of the problem.

We'll be awarding cows to the top 3 performers (ignoring time penalty) in this week's problem set, as well as candy to everyone who solves at least 4 problems. Be sure to do the problems when you get a chance to.

Thanks for coming today, and we'll see you all next week!
