# Solutions

The solution slides we presented today can be found [here](https://discord.com/channels/722538361247498371/724852963885056070/1156788682238460024).
We encourage everyone to implement the problems after reading the solutions, both for implementation practice and a better understanding of the problem.

We'll be awarding cows to the top 3 performers (ignoring time penalty) in this week's problem set, as well as candy to everyone who solves at least 3 problems. Be sure to do the problems when you get a chance to.

Thanks for coming today, and we'll see you all next week!
