The slides we presented today can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1n7EXY-uAJUsC0SwaRrPLTd7grcw5TY6ZtRHZztlVh5U/edit?usp=sharing).

Our next meeting will be four weeks later, so our problemset will be a bit larger this time.
We'll be awarding cows to the top 3 performers and candy for everyone who solves at least 5 problems.

This was our last meeting of 2023. Thank you all for the great semester. Good luck on your finals, enjoy your winter break, and we'll see you in 2024.
