## Conclusion

This is our last meeting of 2024. You can work on this week's problemset over winter break, and we might add new problems to it in the future. We'll be awarding cows and jellies to the top performers. In addition, good luck on the USACO competition this weekend. Thank you all for the great semester. Good luck on your finals, enjoy your winter break, and we'll see you in 2025.
