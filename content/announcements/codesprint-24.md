Last Saturday, May 18th, our club participated in [CodeSprint LA '24](https://codesprintla.uclaacm.com/), a 5 hour ICPC-style contest open to teams all around the world.

Congratulations to our team, CCA Conspiracy, which placed 2nd in the high school division and solving 12 out of the 13 problems!
