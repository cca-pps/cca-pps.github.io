## Conclusion

Overall, it was a great year of PPS. Our teams consistently ranked in nationwide competitions, and we saw many of our members promote in USACO. We also had a lot of fun chatting, collaborating, and solving problems in our weekly meetings. Many thanks to the officers this year for running the club.

We'll be seeing a few seniors graduate this year; we'll miss you and come back to visit often! For the rest of you, we look forward to seeing you again for the 2024-25 school year. Have a great summer everyone!
