Last Saturday, April 27th, 3 teams represented our club at [CALICO Spring '24](https://calico.cs.berkeley.edu/).

Competing amongst over 500 other teams and 900 other competitors,
members worked together in their teams of 3 during the 3-hour contest to solve 10 challenging algorithmic tasks across 15 subparts. In this contest, CALICO also implemented a medal system, awarding gold, silver, and bronze medals (they call them bricks) to the top 1/12, 1/6, and 1/3 of teams.

The complete scoreboard can be found [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20240429154557/https://calicojudge.com/public).

Congratulations to
* CCA Conspiracy placing 12th and winning a gold brick
* CCA Unkindness placing 65th and winning a bronze brick
* CCA Treachery placing 82nd and winning a bronze brick
