The 2023 December USACO contest happened from 12/15-12/18.
The problems and results can be found on their website [here](http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=dec23results).

Students were given 4 hours to solve 3 challenging algorithmic tasks.
The contest was split into four divisions of different difficulty levels and doing well in a division would promote a student to the next division. 

CCA students performed very well this contest, and there were many club members who promoted.

Congratulations to:

- Stephen Zhu who promoted to the platinum division (with a perfect score!)
- Lucas Han who promoted to the platinum division
- Lawrence Liu who promoted to the gold division
- Hansen He who promoted to the gold division
- Kai Yi who promoted to the gold division
- Ethan Song who promoted to the silver division

For those of you who didn't promote, be sure to continue working on our weekly problem sets for practice, and best of luck in the January contest.
