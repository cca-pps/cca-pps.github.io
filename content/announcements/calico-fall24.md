Last Saturday, November 16th, 6 teams represented our club at [CALICO Fall '24](https://calico.cs.berkeley.edu/). This is the most number of teams we've had, and our best showing yet!

Competing amongst over 800 other teams and 1800 other competitors, members worked together in their teams of 3 during the 3-hour contest to solve 11 challenging algorithmic tasks across 17 subparts.

CALICO awards gold medals (they call them bricks) to the top 1/12th of teams, silver medals to the next 1/6th of teams, and bronze medals to the next 1/4th of teams. The complete scoreboard can be found [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20241120234811/https://calicojudge.com/public).
