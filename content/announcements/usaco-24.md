With the results of the US Open being announced a few days ago, the 2023-24 USACO contest season has officially concluded. The results for the four contests this season can be found [here](https://usaco.org/index.php?page=contests).

In each contest, students are presented three challenging algorithmic tasks to be completed in four or five hours. Each contest is divided into four divisions according to difficulty: bronze, silver, gold, and platinum. Performing well in a division would qualify a student for a promotion into the next division.

Our club did very well this contest season, with many members achieving a promotion in one of the four contests. Congratulations to:
